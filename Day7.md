### JavaScript is synchronous, blocking and single-threaded. This means that the JavaScript engine executes our program sequentially,one line at a time from top to bottom in the exact order of the statements


### Call stack: The call stack is a part of the JavaScript engine that helps keep track of function calls. When a function gets invoked, it is pushed to the call stack where its execution begins, and when the execution is complete, the function gets popped off the call stack. It uses the concept of stacks in data structures that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
