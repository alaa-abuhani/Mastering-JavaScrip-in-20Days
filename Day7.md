##### JavaScript is synchronous, blocking and single-threaded. This means that the JavaScript engine executes our program sequentially,one line at a time from top to bottom in the exact order of the statements


##### Call stack: The call stack is a part of the JavaScript engine that helps keep track of function calls. When a function gets invoked, it is pushed to the call stack where its execution begins, and when the execution is complete, the function gets popped off the call stack. It uses the concept of stacks in data structures that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

#####  execution contexts : Created to run the code of a function  has 2 parts: 
- Thread of execution
- Memory

##### A callback :  *is a function passed as an argument to another function. 

                    *This technique allows a function to call another function

                    *can run after another function has finished

A callback function can run after another function has finished
Callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. 

##### Higher Order Function :The outer function that takes in a function 
The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value, are called higher order functions.
