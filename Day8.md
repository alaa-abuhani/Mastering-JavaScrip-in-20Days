Closure (scope and execution context)

#### A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. 

*Execution Context :specification to track the runtime evaluation of code
