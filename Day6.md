Fetch is based on async and await

fetch() : method to fetching data from the resource  

Functions asynchronous  running in parallel with other functions are called 

async makes a function return a Promise

await makes a function wait for a Promise


Destructuring use if we need some of the items contained in array or object without edit original array .

Module : A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.

we can use the module  by using the import statement
